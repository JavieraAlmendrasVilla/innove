**Hey there, fabulous readers!** üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Grab your lattes and settle in, because today's tea is all about the rollercoaster world of quantum computing stocks. And honey, it's been a wild ride!

**The Quantum Craze:**

Just a hot minute ago, our tech darlings like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. were the belles of the ball. Their stock prices were soaring higher than our favorite stilettos, all thanks to the buzz around Google's shiny new chip breakthrough.

**The Reality Check:**

Enter Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, serving some cold, hard truth at the CES tech conference. He spilled the beans that "very useful" quantum computers might still be 15 to 30 years away. Talk about a buzzkill! [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/quantum-computing-stocks-sink-as-nvidia-ceo-delivers-a-reality-check-7fbdf443)

**The Market's Meltdown:**

Following Huang's reality check, our quantum queens took a nosedive:

- **IonQ (IONQ):** Dropped a staggering 45.5%, now trading at $27.05.

- **Rigetti Computing (RGTI):** Crashed by 49%, with shares plummeting.

- **D-Wave Quantum (QBTS):** Also tumbled 49%, feeling the heat.

- **Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT):** Fell 45%, currently at $8.98.

**The Bigger Picture:**

While these startups are feeling the pinch, tech giants like Google (Alphabet Inc.) and Microsoft are just shrugging it off. Google's stock dipped a mere 0.5% to $194.66, and Microsoft even saw a tiny uptick of 0.07% to $422.67. Guess it's good to be the queen bee!

**The Takeaway:**

So, what's the lesson here, lovelies? While quantum computing is the hot new trend, it's still strutting down the runway before it hits the streets. Investing in these startups? Majorly high-risk, high-reward vibes. Always do your homework and maybe consult your financial guru before diving in.

**Stay fabulous and informed!** üíÖ
